    Reproduction
14. Negative pregnancy test (serum) for women of childbearing potential.
15. Female participants must be at least 1 year post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using at least 1 highly effective form of birth control (a highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.) Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non sterilised male partner must agree to use at least 1 highly effective method of birth control. They should have been stable on their chosen method of birth control for a minimum of 3 months before Cycle 1 Day 1 and continue for at least 7 months after the last dose. Female participants must refrain from egg cell donation or retrieval for their own use, and breastfeeding from enrolment throughout the study and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study drug. Any non sterilised male partner of a woman of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide (condom alone in countries where spermicides are not approved) throughout this period.
16. Male participants who intend to be sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or use an acceptable method of contraception from the time of screening throughout the total duration of the study and the drug washout period (at least 6 months after the last dose of study intervention), in addition to the female partner using a highly effective contraceptive method, to prevent pregnancy in a partner. Male participants must not donate or bank sperm during this same time period. Preservation of sperm should be considered prior to randomisation. Not engaging in heterosexual activity (sexual abstinence) for the duration of the study and drug washout period is an acceptable practice, if this is the preferred usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic or occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.
